# Adjust padding to distribute gaps more evenly in tiling WM
# Format: pad=HORIZONTALxVERTICAL center
pad=4x4 center

# Fix for inner gaps when resizing window:
# By default, foot resizes by character cells, which can leave visible gaps
# between the terminal content and window edges when resizing.
# Setting this to 'no' makes foot resize by pixels instead, eliminating gaps.
resize-by-cells=no

[key-bindings]
# Disable all key bindings that might interfere with applications
# This prevents foot from capturing special key sequences

# Client-side decorations settings (if needed)

[bell]
# Set window urgency flag on bell character (\a)
# Used by Fish "done" plugin to mark workspace as urgent when commands finish
urgent=yes

[tweak]
# Disable enhanced keyboard protocol (kitty keyboard protocol)
# This prevents Ctrl+G from appearing as [103;5u
# Note: foot doesn't have a direct option to disable this, but we can work around it
